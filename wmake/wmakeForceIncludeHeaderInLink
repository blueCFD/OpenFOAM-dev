# Script
#     wmakeForceIncludeHeaderInLink

# Description
#     Script for patching symbolic link header files that depend on indentical
#   headers as in other libraries, as to rely on the namespaces to tell them
#   apart when loading them forcefully.
#
# Usage
#     wmakeForceIncludeHeaderInLink <targetLibraryFolder> <headerToInclude>
