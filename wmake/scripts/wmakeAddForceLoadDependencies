# Script
#     wmakeAddForceLoadDependencies
#
# Description
#     Script for forcefully closing dependencies of application binaries 
#   built for OpenFOAM:
#       - This way it will no longer require the user to do this step manually.
#       - The downside is that it will add an extra layer that is useless in
#         some cases.
#   NOTE: this script was partially based on the wmake script.
#
# Usage
#     wmakeAddForceLoadDependencies <finalOptionsFullPath> <originalMakeFiles>
