# Modifications
#     This file has been created by blueCAPE's unofficial mingw patches for
#     OpenFOAM.
#     For more information about these patches, visit:
#         http://bluecfd.com/Core
#
#     Modifications made:
#        - Originally derived from the patches for blueCFD 2.1 and 2.2, which
#          were applied to the file makeDerivedFiles.
#        - This script makeVersionResourceFile was later created for
#          blueCFD-Core 2.3-2 and 2016-1, based on the original modifications.
#        - This script has the ability to build the resource files for
#          embedding them in binaries, therefore allowing us to add version
#          information to the binaries for Windows to see.
#        - Cleaned up the code a bit and made the script able to update the dep
#          file and only update the sourcesFile.
#        - Split this script into three:
#          - makeVersionResourceFile
#          - makeVersionResourceDepFile
#          - makeVersionResourceSListFile
#
# Script
#     makeVersionResourceFile
#
# Description
#     Constructs the version resource file.
