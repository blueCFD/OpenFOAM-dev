# Modifications
#     This file has been modified by blueCAPE's unofficial mingw patches for
#     OpenFOAM.
#     For more information about these patches, visit:
#         http://bluecfd.com/Core
#
#     Modifications made:
#        - This script will reinterpret the paths for the object files from
#          the MSys2 path to Windows paths
#        - Technically this is not needed on Linux, unless OpenFOAM's object
#          list shoots up to twice as many in the future.
#
# Script
#     makeReinterpretObjectPaths
#
# Description
#     Constructs the object path list.
