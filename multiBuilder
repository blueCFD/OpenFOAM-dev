# Script
#     multiBuilder
#
# Description
#     Help script for building multiple WM_OPTIONS builds sequentially. 
#   Initially created for building mingw-w32 DP+SP + mingw-w64, including 
#   tutorials that need cross-compiling for their applications.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#---------- Functions -------------

This will run as a scripted multi-builder of WM_OPTIONS based on each
prefs-*.sh version given or additional variables. NOTE: you cannot have the
OpenFOAM environment activated prior to executing this script!!
