#
# Description
#    In-place replacement for sed to run properly in MSys.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#"sed -i" in MSys still doesn't work properly, due to mount issues or ACL.
#if [ -z "`sed --help | grep -e '--in-place'`" ]; then
  sed -e "$1" $2 > $2.tmp
  mv $2.tmp $2
#else
#  sed -i -e "$1" $2
#fi
