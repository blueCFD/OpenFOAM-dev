# 2014-02-21 blueCAPE Lda: Modifications for blueCFD-Core 2.3
#
# Modifications
#     This file has been modified by blueCAPE's unofficial mingw patches for
#     OpenFOAM.
#     For more information about these patches, visit:
#         http://bluecfd.com/Core
#
#     Modifications made:
#        - Derived from the patches for blueCFD 2.1 and 2.2.
#        - Added more seperators, to make it easier to things apart
#        - Added the ability to track phase fractions
#        - Added the ability to track mdEquilibriumFoam and mdFoam relevant
#          outputs
#        - Added the ability to track dsmcFoam relevant outputs

# Query database for Foam Log extraction.
# Each line stands for one query:
#
#    name '/' line selector '/' column selector
#
# e.g.
#    kMin/bounding k,/min:
#
# The extraction will select a line using 'bounding k,' and in the line
# takes the word following 'min:' as the value.
#
# A special entry is the 'Separator' entry which delimits one iteration
# from the other.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#- String to recognise new iteration by (usually same as 'Time')
Separator/^[ \t]*Time = /Time = 
Separator2/^[ \t]*Iteration: /Iteration: 
Separator3/^ExecutionTime = /ExecutionTime = 

#- Time value:
Time/^[ \t]*Time = /Time = 

#- Continuity errors:
contLocal/time step continuity errors :/sum local = 
contGlobal/time step continuity errors :/ global = 
contCumulative/time step continuity errors :/cumulative = 

#- Special for combustion code:
minFu/min\(fu\) = /min(fu) = 
minFt/min\(ft\) = /min(ft) = 

#- Timing:
executionTime/ExecutionTime = /ExecutionTime = 
clockTime/ClockTime = /ClockTime =

#- Courant no:
CourantMax/Courant Number /max: 
CourantMean/Courant Number /mean: 

#- K bounding
kMin/bounding k,/min: 
kMax/bounding k,/max: 
kAvg/bounding k,/average: 

#- epsilon bounding
epsMin/bounding epsilon,/min: 
epsMax/bounding epsilon,/max: 
epsAvg/bounding epsilon,/average: 

#- gamma bounding
alpha1Min/Min\(alpha1\) =/Min(alpha1) =
alpha1Max/Max\(alpha1\) =/Max(alpha1) =
