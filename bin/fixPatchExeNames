#
# Description
#     Help script for renaming executables that have Patch in their names and 
#   create scripts to call the renamed executables. This is necessary due to 
#   Windows Vista/7 security measurements that restricts files named "patch".

This will automatically search files that have patch in their name and end in 
".exe", then rename the executable and create an sh script and a batch file, 
that will call the renamed executable. This is necessary due to Windows Vista/7 
security measurements that restricts files named "patch".
