Modifications
    This file has been modified by blueCAPE's unofficial mingw patches for
    OpenFOAM.
    For more information about these patches, visit:
        http://bluecfd.com/Core

    Modifications made:
      - Derived from the patches for blueCFD 2.1 and 2.2. which in turn were derived
        from 2.0 and 1.7.
      - Always open the files in binary mode, because of how things work on 
        Windows.
        - Note: This modification is hard to stipulate who implemented this
                first. Symscape's port only began integrating this fix after
                blueCFD 1.7-2 was released with this sort of specific fix.
                But it was Symscape that first implemented this kind of
                "binary" fix in OpenFOAM's core code.
