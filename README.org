* About blueCFD-Core
  blueCFD®-Core is an open source project provided by blueCAPE Lda. It
  provides source code and high quality builds of OpenFOAM® and related open
  source projects, as unofficial ports for up-to-date 64 bit Windows 7 to 10.
  Additional tweaks, executables and scripts are also provided, in order to
  maintain usability when working within Microsoft Windows Operating Systems.
  Building for 32 bit and/or running on Windows XP should be possible
  but it is not supported at the moment.

  OpenFOAM is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the
  terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
  Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later
  version.  See the file =COPYING= in this directory or

  License terms under which you can copy the files.
  
  More information about OpenFOAM is provided in the file =README.OpenFOAM.org=

* Information
  This port is not yet fully tested and was done only as an intermediate step to
  go all the way up to OpenFOAM 8.

  This source code is a patched version of the original OpenFOAM source code.
  The modifications made are tracked at the blueCFD project at Github:
      [[http://github.com/blueCFD]]

  The modifications made for the blueCFD-Core project are based on Symscape's
  modifications to the OpenFOAM source code, which are provided at their
  website: [[http://www.symscape.com]]

  blueCFD® is a registered trade mark of blueCAPE Lda:

  This offering is not approved or endorsed by OpenCFD (ESI Group), the
  producer of the OpenFOAM software and owner of the OPENFOAM® and OpenCFD®
  trade marks.

  blueCAPE Lda is a contributor to the OpenFOAM Foundation, but the majority of
  the modifications present in the source code herein will not be accepted in
  the official releases of OpenFOAM, mostly due to the maintenance overhead
  associated to supporting closed-source operating systems and/or due to the
  hack'ish nature of some of the modifications done here.
