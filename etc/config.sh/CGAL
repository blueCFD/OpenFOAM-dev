# Description
#     Setup file for Boost and CGAL include.
#     Sourced during wmake process only.
#
#     If using system-wide installations use the following version settings:
#
#         boost_version=boost-system
#         cgal_version=cgal-system
#
# Note
#     A csh version is not needed, since the values here are only sourced
#     during the wmake process
